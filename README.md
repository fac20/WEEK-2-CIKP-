# [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/about/) FAC20 Week 2 Project :confetti_ball: :construction: 

Each week we are asked to  build a project in teams of four to build a MVP using pair programming in 1.5 days. All work was carried out remotely during the year of Covid-19.

__Week 2 Project Theme__: HTTP (API, fetch, promises).

See [week 2 schedule](https://founders-and-coders.gitbook.io/coursebook/curriculum/http/project) for detailed information on the project and project requirements.

# [Knock Knock Whose Dad?]( https://fac20.github.io/WEEK-2-CIKP-/) Team CIKP

A dad joke and gif generator using two API's :rofl: 

## INTRO

KKWD? is an app to have dad jokes with a relevant gif in your poject at all times. Be the comedian of your dinner parties with KKWD?

Within the app the user will have two options.

## User Journey
1. Title Page loads with app logo and a button as a joke generator
2. User will click the button to be given a random joke and gif
3. The user will be taken to a new page in with the joke will be displayed.
4. If the user is happy with the joke and gif combination algorithm they can select the random button to be given another combo
5. If the user woul like to search for a specific gif they will have the ability to search by clicking the search button.

## User Stories

### Core stories

As a user, I want to:

- See an interesting mashup of different data :ballot_box_with_check: 
- Input information to change the displayed result :ballot_box_with_check: 
- View the app on all of my devices :ballot_box_with_check:
- Since your app will be unique you will need to create your own user stories for more specific features. :ballot_box_with_check:

### Stretch stories

- As an impatient user, I want to see some indication that data is loading :ballot_box_with_check:
- As a confused user, I want to be told when something goes wrong

### Acceptance Criteria
- Query at least two APIs using fetch 
- Dynamic content generated with JS
- A clearly defined user journey, documented in your readme
- A responsive, mobile-first design
- Ensure your app is accessible to as many different users as possible
- Try not to push API keys up to GitHub (since anyone can see them there)
