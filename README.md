# WEEK-2-CIKP-
### Your project this week is to build an app that queries at least two APIs and uses the results to update the DOM. There should be a way for the user to search, filter, sort or otherwise affect what is displayed.

What you choose to build and how you choose to display the data is entirely up to you!

## User Stories
A user story is a description of one or more features of a piece of software.
Core Stories
#### As a user, I want to:
- See an interesting mashup of different data
- Input information to change the displayed result
- View the app on all of my devices

#### Since your app will be unique you will need to create your own user stories for more specific features.
 ##### Stretch stories
- As an impatient user, I want to see some indication that data is loading
- As a confused user, I want to be told when something goes wrong
Acceptance Criteria
Query at least two APIs using fetch
Dynamic content generated with JS
A clearly defined user journey, documented in your readme
A responsive, mobile-first design
Ensure your app is accessible to as many different users as possible
Try not to push API keys up to GitHub (since anyone can see them there)
Planning
During the planning phase we suggest you spend time on:
Exploring APIs you are interested in working with
Considering your user journey
Deciding what you need to build for your Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and splitting up the tasks
Choosing your APIs
Things to check before you start:
Does it support CORS (cross-origin requests)?
Is there a high enough rate limit?
Is a free API key available?
Are you able to use the API without user authentication (oAuth)?
Is good documentation available?
